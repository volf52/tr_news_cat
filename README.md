This is meant to serve as an example of how to structure
and work on your ML projects, and deploy the 
resultant models.

The dataset I have chosen can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/savasy/ttc4900).

- The python packages can be installed via the requirements.txt file (in a venv), or using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (preferred way).
- To get the models and data files, you'll also need [DVC](https://dvc.org/). Just run `dvc pull` in this repo to get the data/artifacts.
